description: EasyRef is a reference-management web app designed to assist college students in organizing online references for their writing projects.
time-frame: 20 days
tasks: User Research, Interaction Design
tools: Miro, Figma, Zeplin
team: Quang Nguyen, Udacity mentors
overview: Most college students rely heavily on online digital texts for their writing projects nowadays. Many students struggle in organizing their references for various writing assignments. Managing online sources with note-taking apps, which is what a lot of students are doing, is tiring and unproductive. There are other specialized reference-management apps out there, but they are often more complicated than necessary for students at the undergraduate level. As a college student myself, I am interested in creating a specialized application - EasyRef - to solve this challenge and get the most out of my expensive education.

user-research: User Research
qualitative-study: Qualitative Study
research-goal: Research Goal
goal-statement: I want to learn about how college students manage online references for their writing projects, including how they are doing this, and what existing products/tools they are using to help them store online sources.
user-interview: I invited 5 college students to participate in a 30-minute in-person interview session.

include-synthesis: okay 
synthesis-1: 1. Students value the management of online references
synthesis-statement-1: All interviewed students and their known friends store online sources in one place for their writing assignments. 
synthesis-2: 2. Specialized reference-management tools are a must for complex writing projects
synthesis-statement-2: Participants who have to do complex writing projects rely on specialized tools to organize their online sources.
synthesis-3: 3. Automation is the ultimate hero
synthesis-statement-3: All participants want their reference-management apps to automate manual tasks that they usually have to do.
synthesis-4: 4. Collaboration support is important
synthesis-statement-4: Students want to have Google-docs or Evernote-style collaboration feature for their teamwork projects.
adjustments: Research-driven Adjustments
adjustments-statement: After having done extensive user research, here are some adjustments I'd like to make
adjustment-1: Provide a browser extension to help students add links quickly to their projects without having to copy and paste links manually
adjustment-2: Develop a web app to give students universal accessibility from any platforms
adjustment-3: Only display the most basic and important information about a source to avoid bombarding students with unnecessary details.

ideation-statement: Some sketching helps me visualize the overall layout and information architecture of the app. This is also great for ideating features and future design iterations.

usability-testing: Usability Testing and Design Iterations
usability-statement: I conducted unmoderated remote usability testing using Lookback. Some students were sent emails with an invitation to participate in the study anytime and at any place they want.
issues: Below are the most significant usability issues
issue-1: The user-information button is currently on the top-left corner of the home page, which is unfamiliar to some users
issue-2: The app currently has very poor color contrast, which hinders readability
issue-3: Some users were not happy with the fact that logging in to the app required them to click two buttons instead of one like many other applications they were familiar with
solutions: Solutions
solution-1: The user-information button is moved to the top-right corner for users to easily recognize its position (design principle applied - usersâ€™ past experiences shape their expectations)
solution-2: Improve the color contrast for the site to make sure it follows WCAG
solution-3: Change the user login flow to help users spend less time signing in
prototype-fixed: okay
prototype-1-fixed: easy-new-fix-1.png
prototype-1-statement: Improved color contrast
prototype-2-fixed: easy-new-fix-2.png
prototype-2-statement: Faster and more familiar login flow
prototype-3-fixed: easy-new-fix-3.png
prototype-3-statement: Sources' information is displayed on the right
reflection: This project has been a delight to work on. Due to having a sufficient timeframe, I followed the double-diamond design process, which I am aware of as being impractical to many real-world constraints. However, it has undoubtedly helped me become a better decision-maker in developing empathy with users and trying to bring to users the best possible products. I am glad that I have helped solve an enduring issue for many college students.
