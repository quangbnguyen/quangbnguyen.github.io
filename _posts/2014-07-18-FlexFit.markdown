description: FlexFit is a personalized fitness mobile application that motivates people to get exercise and actually stick to their plan by having them set up their own daily workout routines.
time-frame: 30 days
tasks: User Research, Interaction Design
tools: Figma, Miro
team: Quang Nguyen
overview: People are concerned about their health and physical shapes. Many people now commit to gym memberships and/or rely on personal trainers to help them lose weight and stay fit. What about people who do not have the time or money to commit to gym memberships but still want to get fit? They need a convenient way to help them exercise more. This service should provide them with the ease of use and the flexibility of setting their own pace to avoid burnout. FlexFit was born to serve that mission.
competitive-analysis: There are currently many smartphone fitness apps on the market, such as Home Workout by Leap Fitness Group, MyFitnessPal, FitOn, Daily Workouts Free, etc. Even Google made their own fitness app. By surfing through these apps and consulting some of their active users, I have identified several critical shortcomings they are having.
competitive-1: Bombard users with too many statistics - most of which are not important to users
competitive-2: Do not allow users to set up their own workout schedule, which makes it hard for them to keep up with their fitness goals.
competitive-3: Do not allow users to create their own favorite batch of activities.
user-research: User Research
research-questions: Research Questions
question-1: Why do people want to exercise?
answer-1: The main reasons are that people want to live a healthier lifestyle, lose weight, and appear more attractive to others. Improving their energy and stamina is also key.
question-2: What concretely happens when they do manage to exercise?
answer-2: When people exercise for the first time, they feel more alert and energized because their heart rates are ramping up and more oxygen is being delivered to their brains. When people manage to exercise frequently with their schedule, they feel like they’ve accomplished something by building their self-discipline. 
question-3: What concretely happens when something prevents them from exercising?
answer-3: When something prevents people from exercising, they’ll probably notice a decrease in muscle mass, which can happen in as quickly as two weeks. Their bone density, flexibility, and overall blood flow also decrease. 
qualitative-study: Qualitative Study
research-goal: Research Goal
goal-1: Why do people want to start exercising?
goal-2: How might we keep people engaged in physical activities?
goal-3: What do people really need in a fitness app?
goal-statement: These findings will inform me about the various aspects of fitness and what features I should build to serve a very niche market of at-home users.
user-interview: Due to financial constraints, I invited 4 participants who are friends or acquaintances, who did not exercise as much as they’d like, and are active smartphone users, to a 30-minute interview session. I asked them about their interests, habits, daily routines, overall health concerns, desirable health conditions, as well as pain points around getting exercise.
user-personas: User Personas
image-1: flex-persona-1.png
persona-statement-1: Cindy highlights the group of people who get tired frequently throughout their day because they are too focused on their work and do not get enough physical exercise.
image-2: flex-persona-2.png
persona-statement-2: Ryan represents the group of people who are engulfed with their working schedule that they have a hard time allocating time to anything else in their life. They want to exercise more often, but they don’t have time to commit to gym memberships.
image-3: flex-persona-3.png
persona-statement-3: Peter showcases a group of people who have placed themselves in worse health conditions due to poor diet choices with daily high-calorie intakes, while seldom engaging in intense physical activity, possibly due to the nature of their jobs. 
research-synthesis: Research Synthesis
synthesis-1: 1. People who do not have the time or money to commit to gym memberships turn to their smartphones to help them exercise
synthesis-statement-1: People who can’t go to the gym or hire a personal trainer for various reasons often seek viable online services that would help them improve their fitness. Smartphone apps offer valuable workouts along with detailed instructions that are convenient to mobile users, which they can’t get anywhere else.
synthesis-2: 2. People don’t want heavy workouts that could burn them out like at the gym or extensive equipment.
synthesis-statement-2: People expect their workout sessions to be relatively short and not as heavy as gym workouts. They want to exercise with the equipment being only their bodies and the grounds in their homes or workplaces.
synthesis-3: 3. Flexibility in setting your own schedule helps ease people into building their own fitness plan
synthesis-statement-3: Giving people the ability to set their own pace and bring together their favorite batch of workouts/activities motivate them to exercise more regularly.
synthesis-4: 4. Having a consistent routine keeps people motivated and actually stick to it
synthesis-statement-4: Routines are what keep us sane in today’s complicated world. Having people turn their fitness plan into routines relieve them from the burden of remembering details and turning their personal mission into habits.

usability-testing: Usability Testing
usability-statement: I invited my study participants to a testing session and observed their behaviours and expressions while using the app.
issues: Below are the most problematic areas in the prototype
issue-1: Sometimes participants had to tap more than one on some buttons because they were a bit small
issue-2: Some participants squinted to read texts because some background images were too bright
issue-3: One participant attempted to re-order of the exercises in one of his routines and failed
solutions: Future improvements
solution-1: Increase the size of the buttons and other affordances
solution-2: Improve the color contrast to follow WCAG Guidelines
solution-3: Add one additional feature to allow users to change the order of the exercises in their routines
reflection: This case study is the product of my training with Design Thinking, supported by resources from the Interaction Design Foundation. The Design Thinking process has been a methodology as well as a mindset in helping me understand people’s problems and figure out solutions, developing empathy and taking into account various perspectives. This experience has taught me to bring about insights, synthesize them in conjunction with my background in Computer Science, and deliver a relevant product to users who care about fitness.
