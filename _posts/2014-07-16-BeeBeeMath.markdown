description: BeeBeeMath is an online math education platform designed to assist kindergarten teachers in educating kindergarteners basic math concepts. It serves as an in-class tool for the teachers to help kids learn and fully grasp the fundamentals of math.
time-frame: 24 hours (Hackathon)
tasks: Research, Design, Software Development
tools: Figma, JavaScript, React
team: Quang Nguyen, Linh Ta
overview: This project was a part of the RevolutionUC Hackathon at the University of Cincinnati in 2019. I partnered with another participant to design and engineer this project. Due to the fact that my partner and I were both passionate about the field of education, after several rounds of discussion, we came to an idea of building an online math education tool to help kindergarten teachers develop their students’ mathematical ability. BeeBeeMath was born.
user-market: Market & User Research
user-market-1: Contemporary literature in Psychology and Neurophysiology indicated that early math education played a critical role in determining children’s academic success in their long K-12 career.
user-market-2: In a research article published on the American Psychological Association in 2009, four researchers found that early number competence in children could predict their rates of growth in the acquisition of mathematics and achievement all through third grade. This meant that supporting math education for children from an early age would create a huge advantage for their future development.
user-market-3: We also looked into the current educational platforms and tools available for children under the age of six. There weren’t a lot of them. The most prominent among these was Khan Academy. Educators at Khan Academy offered this Kindergarten Math program for kids in kindergarten. However, the program is not interactive enough for young children and would not make a good assisting tool for teachers. There were also blogs that had math cheatsheets for kids, but only displaying some cheatsheets would not generate any education.
bee-synthesis: Research Synthesis
bee-synthesis-statement: Based on the current gaps and pain points that we saw on the market, we were tasked with several obligations
bee-synthesis-statement-1: The product has to be an assisting tool for teachers, because the teachers and the kids make the education happen, not the platform.
bee-synthesis-statement-2: The interface has to be super simple, easy to use, and aesthetically pleasing for both the teachers and the kids.
bee-synthesis-statement-3: The learning materials have to be simple, visual, and interactive to keep the children’s attention.

software-statement: The Beebeemath web app was developed with React in conjunction with the library Material-UI in 24 hours.
bee-reflection: We were nominated for Best Design Prize in the competition. Even though we did not win the prize, my partner and I were proud about our achievement and grateful for the opportunity we had to turn our knowledge into a working product that would help millions of young children learn math.
