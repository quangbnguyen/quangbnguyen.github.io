                    <p>Hi, there. My name is Quang, and I am a Software-Engineer-turned-UX Designer who is passionate about providing values for others with technology products. My work focuses on cognitive usability and emotional experience.</p>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at Earlham College, where I discovered my love for technology and design. I aim at integrating insightful design solutions into tech products that help people solve their problems as well as leverage their life. I have previously worked at Earlham College and FPT Software on various design and engineering projects.</p>
                    <p>I love books, comedy, and am a huge Esports fan. Outside of work and school, I also run <a href="https://andrewquangnguyen.com/" target="_blank">Blog Andrew</a> - a lifestyle and self-development blog for Vietnamese youth.</p>
